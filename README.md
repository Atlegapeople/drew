# D.R.E.W. Vending Machine UI

This is a touchscreen-optimized [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project built for the **D.R.E.W.** vending machine system: **Dignity â€¢ Respect â€¢ Empowerment for Women**.

It provides a secure, clean interface for authenticating via RFID or PIN, selecting feminine hygiene products, and confirming dispense â€” all built with modular React components and simulated hardware hooks that can be swapped for real GPIO or serial triggers on a Raspberry Pi.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the UI.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```
/src/app               # App Router pages for welcome, products, dispense, etc.
/src/components        # UI components split by domain (auth, products, ui)
/src/hooks             # Simulated RFID + dispense logic (hardware-ready)
/public                # Assets (images, logos, icons)
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Simulated Hardware Hooks

This project uses mocked versions of:

* `useRFIDListener()` â€“ Simulates RFID scan
* `useDispenseController()` â€“ Simulates dispense delay and callback

These can later be swapped with real hardware integrations (GPIO, serial, WebUSB).
